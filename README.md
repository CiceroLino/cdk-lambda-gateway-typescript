# Welcome to CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

This a small ideia witch I have while was working with cdk typescript in my previos job. So my ideia is create an framework like nestjs to cdk

Features:

    CLI more completed to
        generate crud resource, be http or graphql
        also generate automaticly tests
        also create libraries
        and much more.

For now the `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This [nestjs repo](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) is my inspiration, and for now, my only friends to colaborate to this project is a lot community research and chatgpt (LOL).

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
